# Analyze-Iris-Data-Data-Science-Project
I analyzed three iris species with 50 samples properties about each flower. Implemented an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g.,  Decision Trees, Logistic Regression) and Trained the model on the training set and evaluated its performance on the  testing set. Using simple EDA performed some tasks and visualized using matplotlib and seaborn.
